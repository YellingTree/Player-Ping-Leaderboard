# Player Ping Leaderboard Guide
A simple new leaderboard for the Titanfall Northstar Client. This mod is client side only. The leaderboard mod is toggled in-game by pressing the the F1 Key. As of right now this will be the only option for a keybind. If someone asks I will create a guide on how to change the mod's keybind.

# What this mod does
This mod adds a leaderboard that shows the connected players in a server in a relitivly simple layout. It also shows their K/D for the match as well as the player's ping. One thing that was missing from the orignal TF2 leaderboard. It also supports 24-player server, showing all the players without cutting anyone off and allows you to still see your own ping.

# How do I open the leaderboard?
Simply press the **F1** key to bring up the overlay, press it again to turn it off.

# How to install
Download the PlayerPing.zip from [Releases](https://github.com/YellingTree/Player-Ping-Leaderboard/releases) and place the extrated file **PlayerPing** into the R2Northstar mods folder located here:
>(Location of TF2 Install)\R2Northstar\mods\

# How to Customize
Simply open the **playerping.nut** located here: 
>\R2Northstar\mods\PlayerPing\mod\scipts\vscripts\playerping.nut

You will find various settings that you can change at the top of the file. Open with prefered text editor

# Updating
Follow the steps for installing and overwrite the files when prompted.

# Suggestions or Issues?
Open a issue! Or create a message in a tread under my mod in the discord server and I'll try and address it when I have the time.
